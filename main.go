// Package datatasketches is the parent package for all sketch families and common code areas.
//
// The Sketching Core Library provides a range of stochastic streaming algorithms that are
// particularly useful when integrating this technology into systems that must deal with massive
// data. The library is designed to be easy to use, highly performant, and memory efficient.
